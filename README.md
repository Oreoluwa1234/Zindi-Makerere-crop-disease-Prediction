# Zindi-Makerere-crop-disease-Prediction

In this challenge, the objective is to classify if a plant has been affected by a fall armyworm. This is a binary image classification challenge. The solution will be deployed as part of a mobile-based edge application which can be used by smallholder farmers in Uganda and the rest of Africa to carry out field-based diagnosis and intervene before fall armyworm devastates their maize crop for the season
